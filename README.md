# AI Ingredients & Nutrition Analyzer

## 📖 Introduction
This project was built during the **KAUST Summer Camp (2024/2025) AI Program**.  
Special thanks to our mentor **Dr. Salah Abdeljabar** for guiding us throughout our two months in the program with valuable insights and direction.  

The project aims to help users **make sense of ingredients and nutritional facts in consumable products**—highlighting health benefits, risks, and allergens.  
Users simply take a picture of the product, and it goes through our pipeline:  
1. **OCR** extracts raw text.  
2. **Data Cleaning** improves accuracy.  
3. **LLM** interprets and enriches the text with trusted databases.  
4. **Flutter App** renders the structured output in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🧑‍💻 Our Project
**AI Ingredients & Nutrition Analyzer** is an **AI-powered framework** that extracts and analyzes information from food product labels.  

- 📷 **Capture**: User snaps a picture of a food label.  
- 🔍 **OCR**: State-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition extracts ingredients & nutrition text.  
- 🤖 **LLM**: An AI model interprets the text, adds warnings/allergen info, and enriches with external knowledge.  
- 📱 **App**: The results are presented through a **Flutter mobile app** with a smooth and user-friendly design.  

The system increases **transparency** and helps consumers make **healthier, informed decisions** in their daily lives.

## ⚠️ The Problem
Food labels are often:  
- Complex, inconsistent, and filled with jargon.  
- Difficult to interpret without calculations.  
- Missing clear warnings about **allergens, additives, or risks**.  

📊 According to the **International Food Information Council (IFIC) 2021 Survey**:  
- Only **9% of consumers** fully understand food labels.  
- **6 out of 10** consumers want healthier products but struggle due to confusing labels.  

This lack of clarity can lead to poor decision-making and health risks.  
Our project directly addresses this problem by making **label information clear, structured, and actionable**.

## 🚧 Future Work
We will add in-depth documentation on:  
- **OCR Module** – setup, preprocessing, and performance analysis.  
- **LLM Module** – enrichment pipeline, schema formatting, and example outputs.  
- **Flutter App** – front-end code snippets and API integration details.  

Stay tuned for updates!
